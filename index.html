        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46757976/72781767-f6549580-3bd6-11ea-9afb-39efaef32303.jpg" alt="Xander Apicella Portrait">
        <p> I'm Xander Apicella, a fourth year student at UCSB pursuing a Physics BS Major 
          and a Professional Writing Minor via the Science Communication Track. Outside my studies, I 
          also work as the Project Manager for UCSB's IEEE Student Branch, Science & Tech Editor for 
          The Bottom Line Newspaper, Co-President of UCSB's MSO Student Branch, and a systems engineering 
          contractor for Lockheed Martin.</p>
        <p> My principle interests are in engineering exciting and useful projects, and using those 
          experiences to learn and communicate those learned lessons effectively. Though much of my academic 
          effort has been focused on physics and engineering, I am a life-long writing addict and plan on 
          honing storytelling and scientific communication skills wherever possible in the future. In my free 
          time I like to go rock climbing, get coffee with friends, and write/read fiction.</p>
